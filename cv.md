## About me
I want to become a developer and will devote all my time to it.  I like to finish everything to the end.  Worked in construction and industry.  I got interested in coding when I was helping a kid with his computer science homework.  Participated in online marathons, which further ignited interest in development.

## Code example
```
function getLargestExpressionResnlt(a, b) {
  let result = a + b;

  if(a - b > result) {
    result = a - b;
  }

  if(a * b > result) {
    result = a * b;
  }

  if(a / b > result) {
    result = a / b;
  }

  return result;
}
```
